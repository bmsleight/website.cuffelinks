Now that I finished the first full working prototype â€“ I did wear my cuffelinks all today today. I do work with a bunch of engineers.[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/metro/23215.aspx[(https://web.archive.org/web/20120627194313/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/metro/23215.aspx), but the feedback was quite positive. I even had some request to sell a pair.

Based upon that I set-up a mailing list and put up a Expressions of Interest (EOI) page.
