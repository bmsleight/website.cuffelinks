I am not very good at soldering and for this project with have lots of SMD to get on to a PCB. I have many a swear word and many a curse. So after extensive searching, I have ordered a [Hot Air rework station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vva2t21sOAs). I have also used the [London Hackspace Laser Cutter](https://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/Silvertail_A0_Laser_Cutter) to make a jog and a solder stecil. 

Before a sencil and Hot Air rework station:-

The basic instructions are from [Meat and Networking](http://www.meatandnetworking.com/tutorials/creating-svg-files-worth-of-creating-solder-stencils-from-kicad/), however I add some extra shapes on new layers so I could have a jig. Includeding some screw holes. The same files is used to cut the stencil and the jig, just turn off the yellow and red layers as approproate.

The only problem I had is the sizing was out by 40% increase. This was solved by takign the outsize shape diemensions in Inkscape, and using the re-size function in the laser cutter (interesting) program. Then fiddling around with [Acetate setting](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/london-hack-space/HJ6McVyd8jU) to set a nice stencil.

Now I can spend a day in the holidays trying to solder with little excuses.
