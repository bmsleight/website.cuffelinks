Summary: RGB Components, size matters.

I am tring to work out how many layers of laser cut acrylic I will need, in total. I am using 2mm acrylic.

I have used a nice [python script](https://github.com/bmsleight/chameleon-cufflink/blob/master/case/laser_clear.py) to generate a dxf file than can be laoded on the [laser cutter](https://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/Silvertail_A0_Laser_Cutter). It used the most excellent [dxfwrite](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dxfwrite/). 

At the moment I have six layers:-

It would be nice to reduce this down by one or two. Limiting factors:-

 * Two x Cell battery [CR1216 12.5 Ã— 1.6 height](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battery_sizes#Button_cells_-_coin.2C_watch) total: 3.2mm
 * [PCB Thinkness 0.6 to 0.8mm thickness](http://dirtypcbs.com/) Total 0.8mm
 * Switch - found a [lovely switch 1.2mm height](http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/307/en-b3u-3615.pdf)

Giving at least 5.2mm, which means I can not (thanks to the switch) fit everything in just 5 layers. Top, bottom and 6mm inners. Time to sketch the PCB in [https://www.tinkercad.com/](https://www.tinkercad.com/)
