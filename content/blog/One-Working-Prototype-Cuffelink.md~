One Working Prototype Cuffelink

Now all I had to do it is solder the break-out board.

A microscope is quite useful …

Time to melt the solder paste blobs, “Honey can I borrow a frying pan ?” …

And add some header pins. Although the holes in the board were too small from header pins (my error – I just used a DIP8 footprint), so I used some jumper cables. Volia:-

Will test my soldering, code etc another day.  Was not happy with the cheap solder-paste – so I am on the hunt for better paste and a way to “paint” it on to the boards, without the use of a stencil. I guess at some point I will have to order solder stencil, but then I need to buy a frame to hold the boards. At the moment I will carry on “painting” the paste with the end of a wire.
