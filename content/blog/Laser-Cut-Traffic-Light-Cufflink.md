Summary: Rectangle Laser Cut Traffic Light Cufflink

I had a play with a laser-cut rectangle case for the traffic light cufflink.

Key:-

* Black - ATTiny45
* Green - LEDs
* Purple - switch
* Orange - nylon screw
* Brown - wire to cell
* Silver - cell
* Yellow - push connector to button

Still looks very tight to get the traces to fit on the PCB. This is with an outside case of 13.5 x 22.00 mm. As I write this, I have spun the LED by 90 degrees to give some space for the footprints. Very tight traces, time to run up KICAD and see if it fits.
