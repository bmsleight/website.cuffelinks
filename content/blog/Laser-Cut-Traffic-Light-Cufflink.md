Summary: Rectangle Laser Cut Traffic Light Cufflink

I had a play with a laser-cut rectangle case for the traffic light cufflink. First step was using (Tinkercad)[https://www.tinkercad.com/] to create a 3-d sketch/mock-up. Still looks very tight to get the traces to fit on the PCB. This is with an outside case of 13.5 x 22.00 mm. I designed the screws to be captive between the 3,4 & 5 layers of acrylic. 

Key:-

* Black - ATTiny45
* Green - LEDs
* Purple - switch
* Orange - nylon screw
* Brown - wire to cell
* Silver - cell
* Yellow - push connector to button

Again, I have used a nice [python script](https://github.com/bmsleight/chameleon-cufflink/blob/master/case/laser_RGB.py) to generate a dxf file than can be laoded on the [laser cutter](https://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/Silvertail_A0_Laser_Cutter). Again used the most excellent [dxfwrite](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dxfwrite/).
