I need to upload some of my early models â€“ so here are my first set of 3d-printed cufflinks. They are in plain [stainless steel](http://www.shapeways.com/materials/steel) printed by [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/).

I set up a git repository, so all the software and hardware is fully available. This really is a work in progress and I need to clean off some of the files. There is nothing like making something opensource to enforce good standards on someone.

All the hardware schematics will be uploaded, shortly. In the meantime, load this folder and fire up OpenScad and press F5.
