Following some fun looking at [outlines for laser-cut-traffic-light-cufflink.html](../laser-cut-traffic-light-cufflink.html) I whipped up a quick PCB using [KiCad](http://www.kicad-pcb.org/display/KICAD/KiCad+EDA+Software+Suite). Was quite surprised when all the components fit on the PCB and the routing was possible, I thought it would not work.

You can view all the raw KiCad files in the [git repository](https://github.com/bmsleight/chameleon-cufflink/tree/master/pcb/rectangle-rag-pcb). I test the gerber files at [oshpark](https://oshpark.com/) although I have not ordered them.
