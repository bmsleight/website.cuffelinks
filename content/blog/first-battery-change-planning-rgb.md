Had to do the first battery change on my RAG Cufflinks. I was aiming for three months, but only get just over four weeks. The voltage had dropped – such that the Green was not being displayed well. I have ordered green led (more expensive!) with a lower forward voltage. (Thanks for the [http://hackaday.com/2012/10/17/traffic-light-cufflinks/](tip hackaday)). Going to a presentation on urban technical colleges (UTC) tomorrow and I bright LEDs.

I have also started work on RedGreenBlue cufflinks, to produce any colour. Again I need to play some tricks with the voltage, 5V rather than 3V from a coin cell battery.
