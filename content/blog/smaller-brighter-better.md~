I made a new model. Smaller, brighter – the aspects have some separation, far better design – look less chunky.

The size compared to the last version, including a pound coin for reference.

I think I may prefer the Gold finish (old version) rather than the plain stainless-steel-bronzed look.

Full videos – to follow. The [hardware and software is in open source](https://github.com/bmsleight/cuffelink). I need to reduce the internal touch headers to take into account the thinner width of the PCB.
