No, not putting the cuffelinks in a blender. I have been playing with [Blender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_%28software%29) ( a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software product used for creating animated films and visual effects)

I used my models of the metal parts of a pair of cuffelinks and I have a nice video..
