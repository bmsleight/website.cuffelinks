Another package in the post, the new models have arrived in physical form

Or in side view:-

I like that the “engraving” of cuffelink.com has come out very well. Although the plastic connector is still a little to high as the smaller threading is not working. I am waiting for the PCB to be delivered, but I may have to sand the connectors (I ordered extra from shapeways.com)

The parts from different angles:-

See my previous post, about the new models, and the latest prototype is a little bigger. Also so 50p and 5p coins to give some scale.

Not sure on the colour. The new model were Gold Plated Matte, the older model were Bronze Plated Matte. I think I may revert back to plain old Stainless Steel for the next model, (or even Silver depending upon confidence.)

My PCB are in the post, can not wait for them to be delivered. Even have a Microscope standing by for the soldering.
