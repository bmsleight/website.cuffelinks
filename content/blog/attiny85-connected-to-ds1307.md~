ATTiny85 connected to DS1307. This show the microchip, communicating with the Real Time Clock Chip (DS1307). Then showing the read time by flashing LED.

The code is available [http://cuffelink.com/code/?p=cuffelink.git;a=tree;f=software/micro/arduino/attiny_to_rtc](https://github.com/bmsleight/cuffelink/tree/05ba9009046ccf2ed7d6e3ad26914c2f1193df8d/software/micro/arduino/attiny_to_rtc);

So I have the traffic signals part working, the clock part working. Time to combine them and see if I get under the size of 4k
