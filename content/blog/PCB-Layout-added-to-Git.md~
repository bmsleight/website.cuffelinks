I added the PCB layout to the git repository. I have ordered the PCB from the wonderful, [oshpark](http://oshpark.com/). The latest pcbs cost me $1.70 per batch of three, plus $5 delivery.

Whilst I am waiting for these to arrive, below are photos of the last batch. I soldered them using, solder paste and a hot saucepan.

Added power (no battery holder at the moment) and hey presto, they actually work.

A fairly low quality video, showing the LED blinking. Minor problems, like wiring the LED in the wrong order and programming the microprocessor at 1MHz not 8Mhz aside, a fairly successful prototype.
