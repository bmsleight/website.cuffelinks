Got my latest prototype delivered. As ever ordered from shapeways.com, with quicker delivery than expected.

I think the cufflinks look great:-

The three main parts are the cufflink body, the purple plastic connector and the cufflink lower. As always the source files are in the repository. The cufflink lower fitted the connector very well.

However I had made some mistake on the connector. In that the it did not screw in to the cufflink lower, without a little overhang (and to be honest a little sanding of the plastic connector).

But even worse, I made a mistake so that the lovely PCBs  do not quite fit into the cufflink lower, as I forgot to take into account the inner threads.

Anyway, so how do they look when on ?

So I quite like them!

But, but, the plastic connector and the cufflink lower, is not strong enough. After a few hours, the plastic part gave in. I think the main reason is the tread is too small and the length of tread is too short.

So, back to the metaphorical drawing board.

Or a nice see-though look:-

Or cut-away, (although in single colour):-

Another set ordered. In the meantime I need to work on the PCBs.
