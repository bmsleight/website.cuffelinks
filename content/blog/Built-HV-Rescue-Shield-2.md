Just built the wonderful [HV Rescue Shield 2 from Mightohm.com](http://mightyohm.com/blog/products/hv-rescue-shield-2-x/).

Whilst I am waiting for these to arrive, below are photos of the last batch. I soldered them using, solder paste and a hot saucepan.

Hopefully, this allow me to use pin 1 on an ATTINY as something other than the reset pin. Using the Rescue Shield to revert pin 1 back to reset pin, so the ATTINY can be re-flashed.

My current working schematic, needs to use 6 pins of the ATTINY85, so this is a much needed device. I plan to play with a rescue shield device tomorrow, on a side education project which gives me a change to play with pin 1 and the rescue shield.

I still think I am one of the worlds worst solderers.
