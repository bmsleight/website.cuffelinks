I set up a [git repository](https://github.com/bmsleight/cuffelink/), so all the software and hardware is fully available. This really is a work in progress and I need to clean off some of the files. There is nothing like making something opensource to enforce good standards on someone.

All the hardware schematics will be uploaded, shortly. In the meantime, [load this folder](https://github.com/bmsleight/cuffelink/tree/master/hardware/case) and fire up [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/) and press F5.
