I am working on making a silver version of the cuffelinks. I ordered the prototypes in “Strong and Flexible Plastic” from the Wonderful Shapeways.com

They look excellent and I can not find any flaws in the design. I going to check over the next few days and then order some Silver versions. I also made a plain matching tie pin, not electronics, but it matches the style of the cuffelink.
