So we got a post on [Hackaday. Very nice write-up](http://hackaday.com/2012/10/17/traffic-light-cufflinks/).

Some nice comments, some help on issue where only two of the three LEDs flash when trying to signal a zero. To be honest I am thinking about kickstarter type of funding, but maybe do a few more prototypes.

Got a new phone stand, so I produced a better video
