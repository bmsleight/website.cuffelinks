The prototypes are working fine, but occasionally the power is lost and the time resets. Looks like the only way I can solve this is to have a small spring to keep the battery connected.

I been looking around, googling and become a minor expert on springs. I need low height spring, diameter equal to cell battery or smaller. I did get some disc springs [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belleville_washer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belleville_washer) but this are hard to connect to a wire.

There is no off-the-shelf item available to me in the UK. I got some prices, but from the UK these were ~£5 per spring plus VAT plus shipping. Where are China are ~$0.01. Even with shipping costs, bank transfers and exchange rate – it just silly price difference

Hence I now have 1000 springs to try out.

#### Edit

Springs worked. Long stripped end of wire, twist on to spring at widest point (top). The cut, strip and solder on to PCB.
